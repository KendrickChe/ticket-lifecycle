<h2>Ticket Lifecycle Stages</h2>

**Ticket Lifecycle: Sev-A (1 hour, 24/7) [Entire Mobile/Online Banking System is Down]**

1. **Identification**:
   - The process begins when an issue is identified. In this case, it's a critical issue where the entire mobile/online banking system is down.

2. **Classification**:
   - The issue is classified according to its severity. Since it's a Sev-A issue, it's categorized as the highest severity level, indicating a critical system outage.

3. **Assignment**:
   - The ticket is assigned to the appropriate team or individuals with the necessary expertise to handle such critical incidents. In this case, it's assigned to the "SysAdmins."

4. **Resolution**:
   - Given the Sev-A SLA of 1 hour (24/7), the SysAdmins must respond to and resolve the issue within one hour, regardless of the time of day.

5. **Closure**:
   - Once the issue is resolved, the ticket can be closed, and the system should be up and running again.

**Ticket Lifecycle: Sev-B (4 hours, 24/7) [Accounting Department Needs Adobe Upgrade, Broken]**

1. **Identification**:
   - The issue is identified, which is an Adobe upgrade request with some broken functionality in the accounting department.

2. **Classification**:
   - The issue is classified as Sev-B, indicating a significant but not critical issue.

3. **Assignment**:
   - The ticket is assigned to the team responsible for software and system upgrades.

4. **Resolution**:
   - The Sev-B SLA allows 4 hours for resolution (24/7), so the team should address the issue within this timeframe.

5. **Closure**:
   - Once the Adobe upgrade and any broken functionality are addressed, the ticket can be closed.

**Ticket Lifecycle: Sev-B/C (2 hours, business hours) [CFOâ€™s Laptop Seems a Bit Slow]**

1. **Identification**:
   - The issue is identified as the CFO's laptop running slowly.

2. **Classification**:
   - The issue is classified as Sev-B/C, indicating a moderate issue that can wait for resolution during business hours.

3. **Assignment**:
   - The ticket is assigned to the IT support team responsible for user devices.

4. **Resolution**:
   - Given the Sev-B/C SLA of 2 hours during business hours, the IT support team should address the issue within this timeframe.

5. **Closure**:
   - Once the CFO's laptop performance issue is resolved, the ticket can be closed.

This ticket lifecycle process ensures that issues are identified, categorized, assigned to the right teams, resolved within defined SLAs, and finally closed once the problem is resolved. The severity level and SLAs help prioritize and manage tickets effectively based on their impact and urgency.
